Octopus Recordings boss Sian offers up a first listen of his forthcoming single 'Pulsating Halo' - a sinister dose of jet-black techno with a galloping dancefloor ambition that is full of mischief.

"This track represents the vibe of the warehouse concept we are doing lately - a dark, energetic, sleazed-up and adventurous feeling," says Sian. "Like Techno stripped down to the raw essentials, new-school, and featuring unabashedly creeped out vocals, as ominous as the times we are living in!"

'Pulsating Halo' drops on October 22 via Octopus Recordings.
